## About Apache InLong

As the industry's first one-stop, full-scenario, open-source massive data integration framework, Apache InLong provides automatic, safe, reliable, and high-performance data transmission capabilities to facilitate businesses to build stream-based data analysis, modeling, and applications quickly. At present, InLong is widely used in various industries such as advertising, payment, social networking, games, artificial intelligence, etc., serving thousands of businesses, among which the scale of high-performance scene data exceeds 1 trillion lines per day, and the scale of high-reliability scene data exceeds 10 trillion lines per day.

The core keywords of InLong project positioning are "one-stop" and "massive data". For "one-stop", we hope to shield technical details, provide complete data integration and support services, and implement out-of-the-box; With its advantages, such as multi-cluster management, it can stably support larger-scale data volumes based on trillions of lines per day.

## Overview of version 1.9.0

## 1.9.0 Feature Introduction

### Observability Capability Building

In the application process of Apache InLong, the following scenario requirements are often encountered:

- Locate the problematic code through detailed link call data (Tracing)
- Query and analyze the abnormal module and associated logs to find the core error information (Logs)
- Open the monitoring dashboard to find abnormal phenomena and locate the abnormal module through queries (Metrics)
- Discover anomalies through various preset alarms (Metrics/Logs)

In version 1.9.0, @ZhaoNiuniu has contributed to the complete observability capability building of InLong based on OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry provides flexible, convenient, and rich Span customization capabilities, such as adding custom attributes, adding events, etc. By embedding points in the core positions of the code, the data can be displayed in the backend UI. The entire solution mainly includes the following steps:

- The application pushes the Trace, Log, and Metric data collected through instrumentation to the otel collector using the otlp-exporter;
- The otel collector collects and converts the data, then exports it to Jaeger, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch;
- Grafana configures the three data sources for unified display, query, monitoring, and alerting.

### Optimize DataProxy C++ SDK

The older version of DataProxy C++ SDK was developed based on the C language, which had limited extensibility. The use of the singleton pattern resulted in performance limitations, and the handling of failed sending scenarios was unreasonable, which could easily trigger coredump. Therefore, the SDK has been optimized with the following improvements:

- Adopt the C++ development mode, refactor DataProxy C++ SDK, no longer limited by the C language, enhancing the extensibility of the code;
- A single process supports multiple SDK instances, allowing horizontal scaling by adding SDK instances, breaking through performance limitations;
- Decouple data reception and data transmission, allowing separate configuration of the number of threads for receiving and sending, improving the SDK's scalability;
- Decouple the SDK's data packaging logic from the business thread, reducing the impact on the business thread while improving the packaging performance;
- Resolve the issue of the older version SDK causing coredump due to sending failures from the root.

With these optimizations, the DataProxy C++ SDK becomes more efficient, scalable, and reliable, providing better data processing capabilities for Apache InLong users.

### Optimize metadata update logic of DataProxy

DataProxy fetches metadata configuration from Manager, but sometimes due to network issues, misoperations, or other reasons, DataProxy may obtain incorrect metadata configuration from Manager. In version 1.9.0, DataProxy has added a protection mechanism for metadata configuration updates, enhancing the reliability of Apache InLong in extreme scenarios. The logic of the metadata configuration update protection mechanism is as follows:

- When DataProxy receives a new metadata configuration from Manager, it first checks the configuration's validity, such as checking for null values, incorrect formats, etc., to ensure that the received configuration is correct and complete.
- DataProxy compares the new configuration with the current configuration. If there are no significant differences, it ignores the new configuration and continues using the current one. This helps avoid unnecessary updates and reduces the impact on the system.
- If the new configuration has significant differences from the current configuration, DataProxy will update its internal data structures and processing logic accordingly, ensuring that the system can adapt to the new configuration without causing errors or data loss.
- In case the new configuration causes errors or issues, DataProxy will roll back to the previous configuration and report the problem to Manager, allowing the system to maintain its stability and reliability.

By implementing this protection mechanism for metadata configuration updates, Apache InLong can better handle extreme scenarios and ensure the reliability of its data processing capabilities.

### TubeMQ command-line tool

To enable Apache InLong operations and maintenance personnel to perform various operations simply, quickly, and flexibly in terminal windows in server management and DevOps scenarios, TubeMQ provides command-line tools to manage topics, produce and consume messages, and manage consumer groups through command-line parameters or options. For detailed usage documentation, please refer to [TubeMQ Command-line Tools](https://inlong.apache.org/docs/modules/tubemq/commandline_tools/). The main features include:

- Managing topics: creating, deleting, and querying topics, as well as setting topic attributes such as the number of partitions and replication factor.
- Producing messages: sending messages to specified topics, with support for custom message content, key, and partition.
- Consuming messages: consuming messages from specified topics and partitions, with support for specifying consumer groups and offsets.
- Managing consumer groups: creating, deleting, and querying consumer groups, as well as setting consumer group attributes such as rebalancing and offset management.
- Monitoring and statistics: collecting and displaying various statistics and metrics related to topics, producers, consumers, and consumer groups, helping users understand the system's performance and status.

By providing these command-line tools, Apache InLong allows operations and maintenance personnel to manage and operate TubeMQ more easily and efficiently in various scenarios.

```
$ bin/tubectl [options] [command] [command options]
$ bin/tubectl topic -h
$ bin/tubectl message produce
$ bin/tubectl message consume
$ bin/tubectl cgroup list
```

### Automatically switch write modes of Iceberg

Currently, the real-time synchronization from MySQL to Iceberg uses the upsert mode by default during the full data phase. The upsert implementation in Iceberg involves a delete operation followed by an add operation, with the delete operation resulting in the creation of a large number of delete files. This significantly impacts query efficiency. This optimization enables the task to use Append mode during the full data phase and automatically switch to Upsert mode during the incremental phase. The implementation involves the source carrying metadata fields in the data to determine which write mode to use in the Iceberg writer. When switching write modes, the data is refreshed, and the metadata fields are removed during the actual write operation.

### Manager support resource migration between tenants

After InLong supports multi-tenancy, InLong Groups upgraded from older versions will be defined under the public tenant, while newly created InLong Groups will be defined within the tenant under the user's name. This leads to users frequently switching between multiple tenants to use resources. This optimization supports the migration of InLong Groups between different tenants, while also validating and automatically creating corresponding cluster labels, data nodes, and other resources.

## Follow-up planning

In the 1.9.0 version, the community has also refactored the DataProxy C++ SDK, enriched the Flink 1.15 Connector, and improved data synchronization features. In subsequent versions, InLong will continue to enrich the Flink 1.15 Connector, enhance the scheduling capabilities of data synchronization, and improve the Agent's file collection capabilities. We look forward to more developers participating and contributing.
