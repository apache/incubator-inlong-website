Apache InLong recently released version 1.9.0, which closed about 200+ issues, including 2+ major features and 30+ optimizations. The main improvements include building observability capabilities and optimizing DataProxySDK-CPP. After the release of version 1.9.0, Apache InLong has enhanced its observability capabilities in areas such as end-to-end tracing, metric collection, access and visualization, and alerting. This addresses the need for rapid problem diagnosis and performance optimization during development and operations, improving the user experience for Apache InLong's operation and maintenance.

## About Apache InLong

As the industry's first one-stop, full-scenario, open-source massive data integration framework, Apache InLong provides automatic, safe, reliable, and high-performance data transmission capabilities to facilitate businesses to build stream-based data analysis, modeling, and applications quickly. At present, InLong is widely used in various industries such as advertising, payment, social networking, games, artificial intelligence, etc., serving thousands of businesses, among which the scale of high-performance scene data exceeds 1 trillion lines per day, and the scale of high-reliability scene data exceeds 10 trillion lines per day.

The core keywords of InLong project positioning are "one-stop" and "massive data". For "one-stop", we hope to shield technical details, provide complete data integration and support services, and implement out-of-the-box; With its advantages, such as multi-cluster management, it can stably support larger-scale data volumes based on trillions of lines per day.

## Overview of version 1.8.0

Apache InLong recently released version 1.9.0, which closed about 200+ issues, including 2+ major features and 30+ optimizations. The main improvements include building observability capabilities and optimizing DataProxySDK-CPP. After the release of version 1.9.0, Apache InLong has enhanced its observability capabilities in areas such as end-to-end tracing, metric collection, access and visualization, and alerting. This addresses the need for rapid problem diagnosis and performance optimization during development and operations, improving the user experience for Apache InLong's operation and maintenance.

## 1.9.0 Feature Introduction

### Observability Capability Building:

In the application process of Apache InLong, we often encounter the following scenarios:

- Locate the problematic code through detailed link call data (Tracing).
- Query and analyze the abnormal module and associated logs to find the core error information (Logs).
- Open the monitoring dashboard to find abnormal phenomena and locate the abnormal module through queries (Metrics).
- Discover anomalies through various preset alarms (Metrics/Logs).
For this purpose, we investigated the mainstream observability building solutions in the industry, and ultimately, skywalking and opentelemetry entered the selection process. After comparison, we chose opentelemetry, mainly due to the Trace (link tracking) aspect: opentelemetry provides more flexible, convenient, and rich Span customization capabilities, such as adding custom attributes and events. It can be displayed in the backend UI with just development in the code.

#### Implementation Plan

- The application will push the trace, log, and metric data collected through instrumentation to the otel collector using the otlp-exporter.
- The otel collector collects and converts the data, then exports it to Jaeger, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch.
- Grafana configures the three data sources for unified display, query, monitoring, and alerting.

## Follow-up planning

In the 1.9.0 version, the community has also refactored the DataProxy C++ SDK, enriched the Flink 1.15 Connector, and improved data synchronization features. In subsequent versions, InLong will continue to enrich the Flink 1.15 Connector and enhance the scheduling capabilities of data synchronization, and we look forward to more developers participating and contributing.
